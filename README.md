To run the project do next steps:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Things that need to be done:
1. Optimize the child components to prevent them from rendering(by using React.memo)
2. Separate some logic into hooks in the Calculator module (as I did in LoginForm module)
3. Use lazy loading for routes, to optimize the bundle size
